Single controlled GitHub-to-WordPress bridge over authenticated HTTPS REST with optional local WP-CLI recovery.

== Description ==

WordPress Connector is the canonical single-plugin bridge for WordPress posts/pages/CPTs, Gutenberg, Elementor, WooCommerce, ACF, Yoast SEO, media, terms, menus, options, controlled filesystem access and controlled system actions behind separate safety gates.

The default GitHub workflow uses a temporary GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runner and authenticates to WordPress over HTTPS with a WordPress Application Password. No GitHub Client ID is stored in WordPress and no VPS or continuously running self-hosted GitHub Actions runner is required.

Elementor writes use Elementor's document save API for element data and page settings, followed by readback verification. The connector exposes active Elementor capability/usage inventory plus complete V3 Form and V4 Atomic Form inspection/upsert with runtime-schema validation and rollback. Elementor-built pages and posts get an "Export Elementor JSON" row action in WordPress admin; saved templates keep Elementor's native export action, with a connector fallback when that action is unavailable. Pages, posts and saved templates also get an "Import Elementor JSON" action for replacing the target Elementor structure and page settings through the same verified document-save/rollback path.

Local WP-CLI commands remain available for host-local diagnostics and recovery.

== Security ==

REST endpoints require HTTPS, an authenticated WordPress user and the manage_options capability. Confirmed writes, privileged actions, sensitive actions, filesystem writes and system updates use separate WordPress-side gates under Settings -> WordPress Connector. The connector exposes no generic shell, arbitrary SQL, eval or unrestricted filesystem endpoint.

Use a private GitHub repository. Store the dedicated WordPress Application Password only in GitHub Actions Secrets. Do not commit credentials, passwords, payment data, patient/medical records or other sensitive production records to GitHub.

== Changelog ==

= 1.8.0 =
* Add "Import Elementor JSON" actions for WordPress Pages, Posts and Elementor Saved Templates.
* Allow choosing an existing target and uploading a standard Elementor JSON document up to 5 MB.
* Reuse the canonical ElementorAdapter save/readback/automatic-rollback path; no direct `_elementor_data` writes are introduced.
* Keep row-level export limited to Elementor-built Pages/Posts and the existing Saved Templates native/fallback export behavior.
* Continue the Elementorconnector consolidation into this single canonical live plugin.

= 1.7.0 =
* Restore local Elementor JSON download for Elementor-built WordPress pages and posts from their admin list row actions.
* Keep Elementor's native Saved Templates export action and provide a connector fallback for editable `elementor_library` documents when the native row action is unavailable.
* Build downloads from Elementor's document `get_export_data()` API and emit the standard `content`, `page_settings`, `version`, `title` and `type` fields instead of reading raw `_elementor_data`.
* Require the normal WordPress `edit_post` capability plus a per-document nonce for every local download.

= 1.6.0 =
* Add runtime-aware `elementor.form_capabilities` for V3 Form controls/actions and V4 Atomic Form element/prop schemas.
* Add `elementor.form_inspect` for complete V3/V4 form subtree readback.
* Add `elementor.form_upsert` to insert or fully replace complete forms while preserving all supplied runtime-supported settings, including email/action configuration.
* Validate V3 field IDs and registered submit actions; validate V4 typed props, registered Atomic types, required messages, exactly one submit button and nested-form rejection.
* Add stale-schema fingerprint guards, exact readback verification and automatic full-document rollback on failed writes.

= 1.5.0 =
* Add bounded WP_Filesystem inspection and existing plugin/theme text-file replacement with dedicated gates, checksums, validation, readback and rollback.

= 1.4.0 =
* Add controlled plugin-settings bridge and plugin-specific safe settings adapters.

= 1.3.0 =
* Add read-only `elementor.inventory` with paginated site-wide Elementor document scanning.
* Identify registered widget provenance as Elementor Core, Elementor Pro, plugin add-on, theme or unknown, including available version metadata.
* Count widget usage per document and report widget types that remain in saved Elementor data but are no longer registered.
* Report legacy section/column, container and Atomic element architecture usage per document.

= 1.2.0 =
* Consolidate the active WordPress/Elementor route into one canonical WordPress Connector plugin.
* Add first-class Yoast SEO inspect/update actions with dry-run, fingerprint, readback and rollback support.
* Add Elementor document/widget/element/dynamic-tag/breakpoint capability inventory.
* Add safe WordPress Abilities API catalog discovery without generic ability execution.
* Save Elementor element data and document settings through Elementor's document API instead of direct _elementor_data writes.
* Add exact Elementor readback checks after create, replace and patch operations.
* Expand the WordPress settings page with the canonical GitHub Actions setup and legacy-bridge migration guidance.

= 1.1.0 =
* Add authenticated HTTPS REST transport using the existing connector action registry.
* Add request-scoped asset upload transport with strict path and size limits.
* Add WordPress-side execution gate settings.
* Switch the default GitHub request workflow to automatically provisioned ubuntu-latest runners.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial complete connector runtime.
